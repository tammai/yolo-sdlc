description: "Engineers: create a new yolo-sdlc app (Nuxt UI + Cloudflare, risk tiers, engineer review) in a new folder, with the right UI shell for its type, then hand over the setup checklist. Use when someone wants to start a new app for a team, or types /yolo-sdlc:new-app."

# /yolo-sdlc:new-app: start a new app

This is an **engineer** step. It creates the repo that non-engineers then work in with `/yolo-sdlc:idea` → `/yolo-sdlc:ship`.

## Steps

1. **Ask with `AskUserQuestion`**, all in one call:
   - **Type:** *internal* (staff only, behind Cloudflare Access, dashboard UI) / *public* (anyone, landing UI) / *prototype* (preview only, fake data, starter UI)
   - **Data:** *internal* / *personal* (anything about people, e.g. HR: every yellow change is treated as red) / *public*
   - **Name:** offer 2–3 short kebab-case names from what they said (e.g. `leave-tracker`). "Other" lets them type one.
   - **Folder:** default `<current folder>/<name>`. On Windows keep it short, e.g. `C:\Users\<name>\apps\<name>`. Deep paths break `pnpm install`.

2. **Create it:**
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/new-app.mjs" <folder> --name <name> --type <type> --data <data>
   ```
   It copies the scaffold, fills in the name and type, installs the UI shell (dashboard / landing / starter), and makes the first commit.

3. **Install and prove it works**, inside the new folder:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm db:migrate:local
   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
   pnpm check
   git add -A && git commit -m "Install dependencies"
   ```
   `pnpm check` must pass before handing over. If it doesn't, fix it or report it. Don't hand over a broken app.

4. **Hand over** `docs/SETUP.md` as a checklist, in plain words: the GitHub repo and its ruleset, Cloudflare D1/KV, Access or Turnstile, the two Workers Builds, and the owner's machine. Offer to do the parts that can be done from here (for example `gh repo create`), and ask before each one, since they create things in their accounts.

5. **Next:** once it's set up, the owner opens the folder in Claude. The `yolo-sdlc` plugin is enabled by the repo's settings, and they start with `/yolo-sdlc:idea`.
