Proposes first and changes nothing without approval. Use now and then (monthly, say), after a run of rework, or when someone types /yolo-sdlc:learn."

# /yolo-sdlc:learn: turn repeated problems into lessons

The playbook's advice: when the same mistake happens twice, put the fix into the instructions, not into a reviewer's head. In these apps, that's `LEARNED.md`. `CLAUDE.md` imports it, so every session builds with it, and the engineer reviewer checks its **For review** section. `CLAUDE.md` and `REVIEW.md` themselves belong to the plugin and are overwritten by `/yolo-sdlc:update-app`, so lessons never go there.

**Engineers only.** `LEARNED.md` is engineer-owned. If the person isn't an engineer, gather and show the findings, but don't write the file.

## Steps

1. **Start clean** on an up-to-date `main`, then gather:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/learn.mjs" . --limit 50
   ```
   It prints every recorded problem, with its source:
   - `verifier`: issues from build logs
   - `plan-review`: plan review warnings
   - `review`: warnings on merged pull requests
   - `review-local`: warnings from this machine, including ones fixed before push

   It also counts them by area of the app.

2. **Find the repeats.** Read `LEARNED.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `REVIEW.md` first. A lesson is worth proposing only if:
   - the same kind of problem shows up **at least twice** (in different changes, or in different rounds of one)
   - no existing rule already covers it. If a rule exists but was missed, the lesson makes it more specific.
   - it's about **this app**. Anything general, such as a flaw in a skill, the reviewer or the stack's defaults, goes to the yolo-sdlc plugin instead: draft an issue for `tammai/yolo-sdlc` and show it. Don't file it without asking.

   Ignore one-offs, and warnings about engineer-owned files changed by engineers.

3. **Propose, don't write.** Show each proposed lesson as one line, with the evidence under it (sources and counts), and say where it goes:
   - **For building:** a rule Claude follows while building. For example: "Leave requests: always show dates with `formatDate()`; three verifier rounds failed on UTC dates."
   - **For review:** a check the reviewer applies. For example: "Any route that changes a leave request must check the approver role (PR #8, #10)."

   Also propose **removing** lessons that no longer apply: the code changed, or the problem stopped.

   Then ask with `AskUserQuestion` (multi-select): which lessons to add or remove.

4. **Write the approved ones** into `LEARNED.md` under the right heading, one line each: short, concrete, and naming the file or page. Keep the file under about 40 lines. If it's growing past that, merge lessons or move general ones to the plugin. Then:
   - branch `learn/<YYYY-MM-DD>` from `main`, and commit `Learn: <n> lessons`
   - ship it with `/yolo-sdlc:ship`. It's red (engineer-owned file), so it gets the engineer review.

## Don't

- Don't edit `CLAUDE.md`, `REVIEW.md`, skills or agents in the app.
- Don't turn every warning into a rule. Too many lessons get ignored, and repeats are the signal.
