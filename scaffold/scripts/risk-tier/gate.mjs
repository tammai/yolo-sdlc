// Pure merge decision: does this pull request have the review its tier needs?
// Reviewers come from app.registry.json on the BASE branch, so a pull request can't
// approve itself by editing the registry.
//
//   green          → no review
//   yellow and red → an engineer review record for this exact commit (review-record.mjs), which
//                    /yolo-sdlc:ship posts after the engineer-reviewer subagent has reviewed the branch.
//                    Its findings are warnings, never blockers. A person's approval also works:
//                    reviewers.yellow or reviewers.red for yellow, reviewers.red for red.
//
// "claudeReview": false in app.registry.json turns the review record off, so only people can
// clear yellow and red.
